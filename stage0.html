<b> Web basics </b>
<p>
  The <b>web</b> or the <b>Internet</b> are a network of computers that commuincate
  with each other via a known protocol called <b>HTTP</b>. <br>
  This protocol is used to send a wanted URL or website address to the server for example: <a href="www.youtube.com"> www.youtube.com </a>.<br>
  The server finds the requested page and sends it back to the user in HTML and the browser reads the file and displays it to the user.
</P>

<b> HTML basics</b>
<p>
  <b>HTML</b> = Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
  Text = content (or what?)<br>
  Markup = How? (or how you display the content)<br>
  HTML can display content such as pictures <img src="https://www.emojimeanings.net/img/whatsapp-smileys/grinning-smiley-in-a-good-mood-whatsapp-emoji-1F600.jpg" alt="Smily picture" </img>
  and videos as well<br>
  HTML documents are made of <b>elements</b> and we use <b>tags</b> to define them.
</p>

<b>Important concpets to remember</b>
<p>
  <b>Whitespace</b><br>
  HTML ignores white space so it doesn't matter if (for example) the sentence is written in one line
  or not.<br> <!-- like here, on the code there are 2 sentences but they will be displayed as one sentence -->
  <b>Are computers stupid?</b><br>
  In a sense yes, they can do a lot but only exactly as told, if they do something different than expected,
  it is most likley because of us, the programmers.<br>
  <b>Inline vs block</b><br>
  HTML elements can exist inline or as a separate block that has an "invisible box" around it.
